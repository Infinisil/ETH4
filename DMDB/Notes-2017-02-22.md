## Data Modeling

Conceptual Model
 : Real world collection of entities and their relations. A relation doesn't have a direction, it's basically just a set of connections between two entities.

Logical Model
 : Mapping to a concrete logical schema

Physical Model
 : Hardware level implementation (bytes, pages, disks, etc.)
