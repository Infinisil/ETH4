## File permissions

Rights
: Read, Write, Append, Execute, Delete, List, ...



### Row-wise: Access Control Lists

For each right, list principals, stored with file. Easy to change rights, scales well with files. Doesn't scale well in principals.

### Column-wise: Capabilities

Each principal with a right holds a capability for it, stored in principal, not file. Very flexible, scalable, charged to principal. Hard to change access rights.

### POSIX Access Control

Each file 3 principals: Owner, Group, Other (oga). For each principal 3 rights: Read (dir: traverse), Write (dir: create), Execute (dir: list).

## File types

### Directory

#### Implementation

- Linear list (name, block ptr): Simple but slow for lotsa files
- Hash table: Fast lookup, collision problems, fixed size
- B-tree: Increasingly common, complex but scales well

### Others

9 bits for permissions, fill up to 16 bits => 128 file types. Distinguish between binary, text, other file system data, documents, media, used for default applications to open.

### Executable files

Usually magic number in first 2 bytes to recognize executable. Loads, links and executes. In Unix `#!` ("Shebang") scripts. Windows locks executing files to avoid changing binaries, in Unix it just doesn't get removed until it's finished executing.

## File system operations

Create and others: `mknod`, `mkfifo`, `ln -s`, ...

Change access: `chmod`, `chgrp`, `chown`, `setfacl`, ...

Read metadata: `stat`, `fstat`, ...

### Opening

Creates file handle.

Byte-sequence files: Vector of bytes, can append, truncate, update, but not insert.

Random access: Supports `read`, `write`, `seek` and `tell`.

Memory mapped files:Use VM system to cache files, map contents to virtual address space. When paged out, write back to file.

## Disk addressing

Logical block address: Treat disk as linear array of blocks, typically 512 bytes big. Abstraction is applicable to other storage devices (Flash, RAM, RAID, SANs, etc.).

### Implementation of file system

#### FAT-32

Old, no access control, little metadata, limited volume size, no support for hard links, still used :/. Translates names to numbers in the FAT table, which stores data block numbers in a linked list (FAT number equiv to data block number. When FAT gone, file system gone, as the data blocks don't have the pointer to the next one. Poor locality, blocks can be anywhere really. Very simple to implement.

#### Unix Fast File System (FFS)

Basis for ext{2,3}. See [here](youtube.com/watch?v=TMjgShRuYbg).

Maps names to inodes which are just a block containing metadata which contains access rights, (if dir) other inodes, and all pointers to data blocks.

##### Inode format (simplified)

Metadata + 12 direct block pointers + indirect block pointer (points to full block of data pointers) + double indirect pointer (points to full block of pointers that point to full blocks of data pointers) + triple indirect pointer (blablabla), up to terabytes of file size. For small files, special file without pointers, useful because most files are small.

##### Free space bitmap: Stores free blocks in bitmap.

##### Block groups

Keep related files together in block groups. Try to allocate in closest block group.

#### NTFS

Master file table (MFT) contains 1kB big entries containing standard info and additional metadata. For small files: std info + filename + file data. Hard links: std info + filename1 + filename2 + ... + file data.

Bigger files: MFT holds filename + list of extents which contain a variable amount of data contiguous on disk. On allocation a fitting space in searched.

Even bigger files: std info + attr list + additional MFT pointer + filename1 + filename2 + ...

Everything is stored in files, even free space bitmap, master file table (which has a fixed spot to avoid infinite recursion).
