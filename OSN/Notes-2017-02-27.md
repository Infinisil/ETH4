# Scheduling (OSPP Chapter 7)

In what order and for how long allocate resources to multiple clients. Metrics to optimize: Fairness (e.g. FIFO), policy, balance/utilization, power/energy usage. Often it's a trade-off. Sometimes dependencies on *workload*/*architecture*: Batch jobs, interactive, real-time, multimedia, NUMA, multi-node, mobile phone, super computer, etc.

## Trade-offs

- Scheduler complexity/overhead vs quality of scheduling.
- Context switching rates/running different things vs throughput/cache locality

## Goals for different workloads

- Goals for batch workloads: Throughput, wait time, turnaround time (submission to execution), **utilization**.
- Goals for interactive workloads (Word, browsing, etc.): Response time, proportionality (somethings should be faster).
- Goals for soft real-time workloads (Finish in 50ms, get 10ms CPU every 50ms, I/O processing, multimedia): Deadlines, guarantees, predictability.
- Hard real-time (plane control actions, fire spark in engine at right time, mission critical/time-sensitive): (Not covered)

## CPU- vs I/O-bound tasks

CPU-bound
: limiting CPU

I/O-bound
: limiting I/O, short *CPU-bursts*

## When to Schedule

1. Running process blocks (blocking I/O, wait on child)
2. A blocked process unblocks (I/O completes) (may be preemptive)
3. Running/waiting process terminates
4. Interrupt (may be preemptive)

Preemption
 : Task unscheduled without warning, often in soft real-time systems.

Dispatch latency
 : Time to dispatch runnable process

Scheduling cost
 : $2*\text{half context switch} + \text{scheduling time}$

Task (average) waiting time
 : How long it takes a (multiple) task(s) to start executing.

*Time slice* allocated to processes should be much more than to scheduling.

### Example

- Process switch time 1ms, run processes for 4ms => 20% spent in scheduler.
- Run each process for 100ms => up to 5s wait time.


### FIFO/First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Convoy phenomenon: Short processes back up behind long-running processes => long average waiting time. Occurs in FIFO. FIFO works well when tasks have about the same running times.

### Shortest Job First

Minimizes waiting time.

### Execution Time Estimation

For mainframes: Get from user.

For non-batch workloads: use CPU burst times. TCP RTT (moving average) estimator $\tau_{n+1}=\alpha\cdot t_n (\text{measured value}) + (1-\alpha)\cdot\tau_n (\text{predicted value})$

Web: use size.

### Round Robin

Run all tasks for fixed quantum time, everybody makes progress. Rarely what you want, treats all tasks the same. Higher turnaround time but better response.

### Priority Scheduling

Priority for every task. If same priority, use Round Robin or something else. Priority queues: queue of tasks for each priority. For interactive, high-priority tasks: Round robin. For batch, background, low priority, real time: FCFS. Ageing as solution to starvation: Increase priority as task waits longer, reset priority when quantum time is used. Penalize CPU-bound, benefit I/O-bound tasks: Task use full quantum => reduce priority.

### In Linux:

140-level Multilevel feedback queue: priority 0-99: FCFS/RR, 100-139: user tasks/dynamic, Round-robin within priority with ageing.

Completely fair scheduler: Task priority is how little progress it made. Implemented using R/B-tree ($\Omega(\log n)$). Ensures service-rate.

### Problems with UNIX Scheduling

Spawning more threads => more CPU time.

### Resource Containers
