Well-founded relations
 : is an order $>$ on a set $S$ iff there is no infinite decreasing chain $x_1>x_2>...$ for $x_i\in S$.

On recursion, a function terminates for sure if the arguments are decreased on a well-founded relation. Example:

```haskell
-- Terminates
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n-1)

-- Doesn't terminate
g 0 = 1
g 1 = 1
g n = g (n+1) + g (n-2)
```
