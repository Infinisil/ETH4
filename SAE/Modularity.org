* Modularity

** Coupling

*** Data Coupling

Representation Exposure: Try not to expose internal representation, because this couples thes code with the client and is difficult to change during maintenance.

**** Approach 1: Restricting Access to Data

Force narrow interface, hide implementation, no references to subobjects (leaking), no storing of arguments as subobjects (capturing).

Facade pattern: A single, simplified interface without hiding detais completely.
