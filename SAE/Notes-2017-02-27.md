# Modeling and Specifications

Decomposition: Separate components so that changes only affect a few.

### System Design

Components (computational units with spec. interface) and Connectors (interactions)

### Detailed Design

Choose how to implement it.

## Documentation

Documentation is important, code usually isn't self-descriptive enough to justify not commenting it.
