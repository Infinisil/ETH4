# Modeling and Specifications

Decomposition: Separate components so that changes only affect a few.

### System Design

Components (computational units with spec. interface) and Connectors (interactions)

### Detailed Design

Choose how to implement it.

## Documentation

Documentation is important, code usually isn't self-descriptive enough to justify not commenting it. Developers would need to extract information from source code to know the behaviour. Source code does not express which properties are stable during evolution. Example:

```java
// Intended to return the first element? Is returning any element
// allowed when changing the code?
int find(int[] array, int v) {
	for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
		if (array[i] == v) return i;
	return -1;
}
```

### What to Document

For client: How to use, interface.

For implementers: How it works. Describe *what* (with abstraction), not how.

Key properties: Methods & constructors, Data structures, Algorithms

####  Interface Documentation

Constructors, methods

Methods: parameters, input/output state, result, effects (heap/others), complexity.

Global properties: Consistency, invariance, guarantees for various methods/properties, evolution (invariants on sequences of states), abbreviations (requirements or guarantees).

#### Implementation Documentation

Implementation invariants, more details, algorithms, justification of assumptions.


### How to Document

Comments: Simple, flexible, limited to HTML gen, not present in executable, tags (e.g. javadoc), not forceful/relies on convention.

Types and modifiers (e.g. `final`): Also a kind of documentation. Tool support via static checking, auto-completion.

Effect systems (Idris :D): Tool support, overhead vs. benefit
